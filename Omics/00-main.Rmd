# Transcriptomics

## Overview
- @Tachibana2015 a good review of modern transcriptomics sequencing technology and analytic challenges up to 2015. The author first stated the superiority of RNA-seq over microarray by providing more information, followed by a quick review of analytic challenges of RNA-seq data from NGS system. There are two way of RNA-seq data analysis: short-reads analysis (identify pathways but lose information) and long-reads analysis(assemble the short reads). Lastly, the author introduced  a novel concept __integromics__, on the bases of biologyical pipeline (DNA-> RNA -> protein) and nanostring tech for RNA-seq data analysis.
