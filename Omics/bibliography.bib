abstract = {Unwanted variation can be highly problematic and so its detection is often crucial. Relative log expression (RLE) plots are a powerful tool for visualizing such variation in high dimensional data. We provide a detailed examination of these plots, with the aid of examples and simulation, explaining what they are and what they can reveal. RLE plots are particularly useful for assessing whether a procedure aimed at removing unwanted variation, i.e. a normalization procedure, has been successful. These plots, while originally devised for gene expression data from microarrays, can also be used to reveal unwanted variation in many other kinds of high dimensional data, where such variation can be problematic.},

@article{Le2020,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2020, CC BY. PMLB (Penn Machine Learning Benchmark) is an open source data repository containing a curated collection of datasets for evaluating and comparing machine learning (ML) algorithms. Compiled from a broad range of existing ML benchmark collections, PMLB synthesizes and standardizes hundreds of publicly available datasets from diverse sources such as the UCI ML repository and OpenML [1], enabling systematic assessment of different ML methods. These datasets cover a range of applications, from binary/multi-class classification to regression problems with combinations of categorical and continuous features. PMLB has both a Python interface (pmlb) and an R interface (pmlbr), both with detailed documentation that allows the user to access cleaned and formatted datasets using a single function call (fetch_data). PMLB also provides a comprehensive description of each dataset and advanced functions to explore the dataset space such as nearest_datasets and filter_datasets, which allow for smoother user experience and handling of data. The resource is designed to facilitate open source contributions in the form of datasets as well as improvements to curation.},
