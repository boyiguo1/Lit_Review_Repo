@article{Gandolfo2018,
abstract = {Unwanted variation can be highly problematic and so its detection is often crucial. Relative log expression (RLE) plots are a powerful tool for visualizing such variation in high dimensional data. We provide a detailed examination of these plots, with the aid of examples and simulation, explaining what they are and what they can reveal. RLE plots are particularly useful for assessing whether a procedure aimed at removing unwanted variation, i.e. a normalization procedure, has been successful. These plots, while originally devised for gene expression data from microarrays, can also be used to reveal unwanted variation in many other kinds of high dimensional data, where such variation can be problematic.},

@article{Le2020,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2020, CC BY. PMLB (Penn Machine Learning Benchmark) is an open source data repository containing a curated collection of datasets for evaluating and comparing machine learning (ML) algorithms. Compiled from a broad range of existing ML benchmark collections, PMLB synthesizes and standardizes hundreds of publicly available datasets from diverse sources such as the UCI ML repository and OpenML [1], enabling systematic assessment of different ML methods. These datasets cover a range of applications, from binary/multi-class classification to regression problems with combinations of categorical and continuous features. PMLB has both a Python interface (pmlb) and an R interface (pmlbr), both with detailed documentation that allows the user to access cleaned and formatted datasets using a single function call (fetch_data). PMLB also provides a comprehensive description of each dataset and advanced functions to explore the dataset space such as nearest_datasets and filter_datasets, which allow for smoother user experience and handling of data. The resource is designed to facilitate open source contributions in the form of datasets as well as improvements to curation.},

@article{Koch2018,
abstract = {Since the first publications coining the term RNA-seq (RNA sequencing) appeared in 2008, the number of publications containing RNA-seq data has grown exponentially, hitting an all-time high of 2,808 publications in 2016 (PubMed). With this wealth of RNA-seq data being generated, it is a challenge to extract maximal meaning from these datasets, and without the appropriate skills and background, there is risk of misinterpretation of these data. However, a general understanding of the principles underlying each step of RNA-seq data analysis allows investigators without a background in programming and bioinformatics to critically analyze their own datasets as well as published data. Our goals in the present review are to break down the steps of a typical RNA-seq analysis and to highlight the pitfalls and checkpoints along the way that are vital for bench scientists and biomedical researchers performing experiments that use RNA-seq.},

@article{Poplawski2018,
abstract = {Sample size calculation is a crucial step in study design but is not yet fully established for RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses. To evaluate feasibility and provide guidance, we evaluated RNA-seq sample size tools identified from a systematic search. The focus was on whether real pilot data would be needed for reliable results and on identifying tools that would perform well in scenarios with different levels of biological heterogeneity and fold changes (FCs) between conditions. We used simulations based on real data for tool evaluation. In all settings, the six evaluated tools provided widely different answers, which were strongly affected by FC. Although all tools failed for small FCs, some tools can at least be recommended when closely matching pilot data are available and relatively large FCs are anticipated.},
