abstract = {Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide and a major public health concern. CVD prediction is one of the most effective measures for CVD control. In this study, 29930 subjects with high-risk of CVD were selected from 101056 people in 2014, regular follow-up was conducted using electronic health record system. Logistic regression analysis showed that nearly 30 indicators were related to CVD, including male, old age, family income, smoking, drinking, obesity, excessive waist circumference, abnormal cholesterol, abnormal low-density lipoprotein, abnormal fasting blood glucose and else. Several methods were used to build prediction model including multivariate regression model, classification and regression tree (CART), Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes, Bagged trees, Ada Boost and Random Forest. We used the multivariate regression model as a benchmark for performance evaluation (Area under the curve, AUC = 0.7143). The results showed that the Random Forest was superior to other methods with an AUC of 0.787 and achieved a significant improvement over the benchmark. We provided a CVD prediction model for 3-year risk assessment of CVD. It was based on a large population with high risk of CVD in eastern China using Random Forest algorithm, which would provide reference for the work of CVD prediction and treatment in China.},

@article{Ooka2021,
abstract = {Introduction Early intervention in type 2 diabetes can prevent exacerbation of insulin resistance. More effective interventions can be implemented by early and precise prediction of the change in glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Artificial intelligence (AI), which has been introduced into various medical fields, may be useful in predicting changes in HbA1c. However, the inability to explain the predictive factors has been a problem in the use of deep learning, the leading AI technology. Therefore, we applied a highly interpretable AI method, random forest (RF), to large-scale health check-up data and examined whether there was an advantage over a conventional prediction model. Research design and methods This study included a cumulative total of 42 908 subjects not receiving treatment for diabetes with an HbA1c <6.5%. The objective variable was the change in HbA1c in the next year. Each prediction model was created with 51 health-check items and part of their change values from the previous year. We used two analytical methods to compare the predictive powers: RF as a new model and multivariate logistic regression (MLR) as a conventional model. We also created models excluding the change values to determine whether it positively affected the predictions. In addition, variable importance was calculated in the RF analysis, and standard regression coefficients were calculated in the MLR analysis to identify the predictors. Results The RF model showed a higher predictive power for the change in HbA1c than MLR in all models. The RF model including change values showed the highest predictive power. In the RF prediction model, HbA1c, fasting blood glucose, body weight, alkaline phosphatase and platelet count were factors with high predictive power. Conclusions Correct use of the RF method may enable highly accurate risk prediction for the change in HbA1c and may allow the identification of new diabetes risk predictors.},
