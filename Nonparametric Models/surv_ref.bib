@article{Leng2006,
abstract = {We propose a novel model selection method for a nonparametric extension of the Cox proportional hazard model, in the framework of smoothing splines ANOVA models. The method automates the model building and model selection processes simultaneously by penalizing the reproducing kernel Hilbert space norms. On the basis of a reformulation of the penalized partial likelihood, we propose an efficient algorithm to compute the estimate. The solution demonstrates great flexibility and easy interpretability in modeling relative risk functions for censored data. Adaptive choice of the smoothing parameter is discussed. Both simulations and a real example suggest that our proposal is a useful tool for multivariate function estimation and model selection in survival analysis.},

@article{Du2010,
abstract = {We study the Cox models with semiparametric relative risk, which can be partially linear with one nonparametric component, or multiple additive or nonadditive nonparametric components. A penalized partial likelihood procedure is proposed to simultaneously estimate the parameters and select variables for both the parametric and the nonparametric parts. Two penalties are applied sequentially. The first penalty, governing the smoothness of the multivariate nonlinear covariate effect function, provides a smoothing spline ANOVA framework that is exploited to derive an empirical model selection tool for the nonparametric part. The second penalty, either the smoothlyclipped-absolute- deviation (SCAD) penalty or the adaptive LASSO penalty, achieves variable selection in the parametric part. We show that the resulting estimator of the parametric part possesses the oracle property, and that the estimator of the nonparametric part achieves the optimal rate of convergence. The proposed procedures are shown to work well in simulation experiments, and then applied to a real data example on sexually transmitted diseases. {\textcopyright} Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 2010.},

@article{Lin2013,
abstract = {Prognosis plays a pivotal role in patient management and trial design. A useful prognostic model should correctly identify important risk factors and estimate their effects. In this article, we discuss several challenges in selecting prognostic factors and estimating their effects using the Cox proportional hazards model. Although a flexible semiparametric form, the Cox's model is not entirely exempt from model misspecification. To minimize possible misspecification, instead of imposing traditional linear assumption, flexible modeling techniques have been proposed to accommodate the nonlinear effect. We first review several existing nonparametric estimation and selection procedures and then present a numerical study to compare the performance between parametric and nonparametric procedures. We demonstrate the impact of model misspecification on variable selection and model prediction using a simulation study and an example from a phase III trial in prostate cancer. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

@article{Lefebvre2021,
abstract = {Background: In survival analysis, data can be modeled using either a multiplicative hazards regression model (such as the Cox model) or an additive hazards regression model (such as Lin's or Aalen's model). While several diagnostic tools are available to check the assumptions underpinning each type of model, there is no defined procedure to fit these models optimally. Moreover, the two types of models are rarely combined in survival analysis. Here, we propose a strategy for optimal fitting of multiplicative and additive hazards regression models in survival analysis. Methods: This section details our proposed strategy for optimal fitting of multiplicative and additive hazards regression models, with a focus on the assumptions underpinning each type of model, the diagnostic tools used to check these assumptions, and the steps followed to fit the data. The proposed strategy draws on classical diagnostic tools (Schoenfeld and martingale residuals) and less common tools (pseudo-observations, martingale residual processes, and Arjas plots). Results: The proposed strategy is applied to a dataset of patients with myocardial infarction (TRACE data frame). The effects of 5 covariates (age, sex, diabetes, ventricular fibrillation, and clinical heart failure) on the hazard of death are analyzed using multiplicative and additive hazards regression models. The proposed strategy is shown to fit the data optimally. Conclusions: Survival analysis is improved by using multiplicative and additive hazards regression models together, but specific steps must be followed to fit the data optimally. By providing different measures of the same effect, our proposed strategy allows for better interpretation of the data.},

@article{Cui2021,
abstract = {We propose the additive functional Cox model to flexibly quantify the association between functional covariates and time to event data. The model extends the linear functional proportional hazards model by allowing the association between the functional covariate and log hazard to vary nonlinearly in both the functional domain and the value of the functional covariate. Additionally, we introduce critical transformations of the functional covariate which address the weak model identifiability in areas of information sparsity and discuss their impact on interpretation and inference. We also introduce a novel estimation procedure that accounts for identifiability constraints directly during model fitting. Methods are applied to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003â€“2006 accelerometry data and quantify new and interpretable circadian patterns of physical activity that are associated with all-cause mortality. We also introduce a simple and novel simulation framework for generating survival data with functional predictors which resemble the observed data. The accompanying inferential R software is fast, open source, and publicly available. Our data application and simulations are fully reproducible through the accompanying vignette. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},
