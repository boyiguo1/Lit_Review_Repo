abstract = {The evolution of Bayesian approaches for model uncertainty over the past decade has been remarkable. Catalyzed by advances in methods and technology for posterior computation, the scope of these methods has widened substantially. Major thrusts of these developments have included new methods for semiautomatic prior specification and posterior exploration. To illustrate key aspects of this evolution, the highlights of some of these developments are described.},

@article{Breheny2009,
abstract = {In many applications, covariates possess a grouping struc-ture that can be incorporated into the analysis to select important groups as well as important members of those groups. This work focuses on the incorporation of grouping structure into penalized regression. We investigate the pre-viously proposed group lasso and group bridge penalties as well as a novel method, group MCP, introducing a frame-work and conducting simulation studies that shed light on the behavior of these methods. To fit these models, we use the idea of a locally approximated coordinate descent to de-velop algorithms which are fast and stable even when the number of features is much larger than the sample size. Fi-nally, these methods are applied to a genetic association study of age-related macular degeneration.},
