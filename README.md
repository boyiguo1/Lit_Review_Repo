This repo also contains some presentation slides by other authors. I archived those presentation slides out of my personal interests. I hate those great presentations sunk in the ocean of the internet. Hence, I don't own those slides show. If you are interested in those, please contact the original authors whose name should be displayed in the slides.

Meanwhile, if you are the original authors of the presentation slides and not happy of it being display here. Please contact me. I will have them removed.
